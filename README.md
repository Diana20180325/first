# Git

Version Control System (VCS): Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently.

Distributed System: Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed. Each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine, enhancing collaboration and providing redundancy.

Repositories: A Git repository contains the project's files and the entire history of changes. There are local repositories on individual machines and remote repositories on servers.

Commits: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and is associated with a commit message that describes the changes.

Branching: Git facilitates the creation of branches, allowing developers to work on features or bug fixes independently. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when changes are ready.

Merging: Merging combines changes from one branch into another. Git uses automatic merging, but conflicts may require manual resolution.

Pull Requests: In Git workflows, developers propose changes through pull requests (or merge requests). These requests allow for code review, discussion, and integration of changes into the main branch.

GitHub and GitLab: Platforms like GitHub and GitLab provide hosting services for Git repositories, enhancing collaboration, issue tracking, and project management.
